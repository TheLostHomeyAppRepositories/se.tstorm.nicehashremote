NiceHash Remote turns Homey into a control center for your NiceHash mining rigs. Easy access to current hash rate, power usage and profitability. Get notified if a rig changes status (for example goes offline) and set power tariffs to keep track of cost vs profit.

1. Configure app with apiKey, apiSecret and orgId from NiceHash.

2. Add your rigs as devices in Homey.

3. (Optional) Set your electricity tariff and currency using the flow cards "Set power tariff to" and "Set power tariff currency to", and NiceHash Remote will calculate power costs in mBTC for your mining rigs.

4. (Optional, step 3 required) Enable Autopilot on each rig, and NiceHash Remote will automatically start/stop the rigs based on tariff and profitability.

5. Profit!
